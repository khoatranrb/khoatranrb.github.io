##### **3.1. PAC learning**

* In <a href='https://khoablog.github.io/2020/04/05/uml-3'>UML_3</a>, we have shown that for a finite $\mathcal{H}$ hypothesis class and a sufficiently large training sample (follow the $\mathcal{D}$ distribution and labeling function $f$) then output of $\mathcal{H}$ will be probably approximately correct. Now, we define *Probably Approximately Correct* (PAC) learning.

* **Define** (PAC learning): $\mathcal{H}$ is PAC learnable if there exist a function $m_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\delta):(0,1)^2\to\N$ with property:

  * For every $(\epsilon,\delta)\in(0,1)$, every $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathcal{X}$ and every $f:\mathcal{X}\to\{0,1\}$, the relizable assumption (*Giả thuyết tính khả thi* in <a href='https://khoablog.github.io/2020/04/05/uml-3'>UML_3</a>) holds with respect $\mathcal{H,D,f}$, then when running the learning algorithm on $m\ge m_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\delta)$, the algorithm returns a hypothesis $h$ such that, with probability of at least $1-\delta$ that we have $L_{(\mathcal{D,f})}(h)\le\epsilon$.

* In PAC learning, we have two parameters:

  * $\epsilon$ determines how far the output classifier can be optimal.
  * $\delta$ indicating how likely $h$ meets accuracy $\epsilon$.

* **Sample complexity**:

  * The function $m_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\delta):(0,1)^2\to\N$ determines the sample complexity of $\mathcal{H}$. How many samples are required to guarantee property of PAC? It also depend on the size of $\mathcal{H}$.

  * If $\mathcal{H}$ is PAC learnable, there are many $m_{\mathcal{H}}$ that satisfy the requirement given in the **Define**. Thus, we will define the sample complexity of $\mathcal{H}$ so that for any $\epsilon, \delta$, $m_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\delta)$ can satisfy the requirement of PAC. Let remember the conclusion of the analysis of finite hypothesis class in <a href='https://khoablog.github.io/2020/04/05/uml-3'>UML_3</a>. Now we have:

    *Corollary*:  Every finite hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ is PAC learnable with sample complexity:
    $$
    m_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon,\delta)\le \frac{\log(|\mathcal{H}|/\delta)}{\epsilon}
    $$
